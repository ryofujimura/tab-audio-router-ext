# Tab Audio Router

![Route different tabs to different outputs](docs/images/img.jpg)

> Send **each browser tab’s audio to a different device** on Mac.  
> Example: YouTube → TV, Zoom → Headphones.

---

## Why this exists

macOS + browsers don’t let you easily control audio **per tab**.

This fixes that — right from the **right-click menu**.

## How it works

![Right-click menu to choose audio output](docs/images/Screenshot.jpg)

- *May ask for microphone access* so Chromium can label output devices.
- Right-click the **video or audio** element.  
- Open **Audio outputs → Choose output…** and pick a device in the on-page list, or use **Use system default**.  
- Done — that player now uses the output you chose.

## What you can do

- 🎧 Zoom in headphones, music on speakers  
- 📺 Send a tab to your TV while working on laptop audio  
- 🔀 Run multiple tabs with different outputs

## Limitations (important)

- Needs to be tested on web apps(Ex: Zoom web, Spotify web)
- Needs to be tested on browswers (Ex: Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge)
