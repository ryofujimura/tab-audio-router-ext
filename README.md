# Tab Audio Router

![Route different tabs to different outputs](docs/images/img.jpg)

> Send **each browser tab’s audio to a different device** on Mac.  
> Example: YouTube → TV, Zoom → Headphones.

---

## Why this exists

macOS + browsers don’t let you easily control audio **per tab**.

This fixes that — right from the **right-click menu**.

---

## How it works

- Right-click any page or video  
- Choose **Sound Output → Select device**  
- Done — that tab now plays through a different output

---

## What you can do

- 🎧 Zoom in headphones, music on speakers  
- 📺 Send a tab to your TV while working on laptop audio  
- 🔀 Run multiple tabs with different outputs

## Install (30 seconds)

1. Download / clone this repo  
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`  
3. Enable **Developer Mode**  
4. Click **Load unpacked** → select this folder

## Limitations (important)

- Only works on sites using standard `<audio>/<video>`  
- Some apps (Zoom web, Spotify web) may not route correctly  
- Chromium browsers only (Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge)
